"The largest beach in Goa, Calangute Beach is also affectionately known as the “Queen of Beaches”. It is among the top ten beaches in the world, which means it is one of the tourist places in Goa that you should not miss. It is a big, serene beach with activities enough to fill your mind for the entirety of your trip. The beach alone is a great attraction for tourists. The beach is ideal for both the options,  lying down in the sand without the fear of being run over or trying your hand at some water sports.  There are a lot of options to choose from. The distance of Calangute from Baga Beach is not great; the two beaches are only separated from each other by some rocks. You can choose to have breakfast or lunch at Baga or Calangute. There are also many great sight-seeing opportunities near Calangute such as Morjim Beach, St. Alex Church, the Water Pond of Arambol, Ashvem Beach, the Aguada Lighthouse & Aguada Fort, Nerul River, the Friday Local Mapusa Market, River Betul & Betul Estuary";"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sih2020-cad27.appspot.com/o/pic2.jpg?alt=media&token=6f3e4562-fbb3-4d87-a102-a0c2e6ab1084";"Calangute, North Goa";"Calangute Beach";"0";"Beach";"15.5494";"73.7535";"2"

Not so in grand island. Grand Island is the nirvana of Goan water-sports. There is a lot to be experienced here from diving to snorkelling to fishing. Scuba diving in Goa is the most popular activity because it offers so much in terms of underwater exploration.  There are ship wrecks to be found here as well as some reefs. The “Suzy” wreck and the “Davy Jones Locker” are especially popular with divers as are Serge City, Bounty Rock, and Turbo Tunnel.

"The Dudhsagar Waterfalls are situated on the Goa-Karnataka border and are one of India’s must-see sights. The four-tiered waterfall structure is one of the tallest in India and is located on the Mandovi River. The white water cascades down from a height of nearly 1017 feet off a nearly steep mountain face. They form a part of the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, so the best way to reach them is by entering the national park and taking a van allocated by the park to the falls.  The Dudhsagar trek inside the park is closed to the public but you can still reach the waterfalls by trekking from Kulem and following the jeep trail. Another possible route is the trek from Castle Rock in Karnataka. Reaching the waterfalls will not be an easy task but it is one that is worth every ounce of effort put into it.  They are best experienced during the monsoons as they lose their force during the dry season.

"Another heritage from the Portuguese, Fort Aguada has been standing stern on the beach facing the Arabian Sea from 1612 when it was built in order to provide defence against the invading Dutch and the Marathas. It was a grand old fort in its time with the capacity to hold 79 cannons among other weapons of defense. It was one of the prized possessions of the Portuguese. Today, it stands as a famous landmark dividing the Sinquerium Beach and the Candolim Beach.  There is an old lighthouse standing within the fort which was built in 1864, the oldest lighthouse of its shape and size in India. Fort Aguada is a great place to explore when you are out visiting the Candolim or Sinquerium Beaches.

You can perform a whole host of activities on the beach including a vast array of water sports, all at very reasonable prices. You can choose to spend some time at Candolim Beach and then head over to Calangute next door or just spend all your day on this beach and explore the sights nearby.  Renting a scooter in order to get around freely is the best option and will only cost around Rs.300/- for the day. Many churches and chapels dot its neighbourhood and there is also an old lighthouse which stands inside Fort Aguada. The Fort Aguada Jail is also a tourist attraction.

Tito’s Street, named after the street it is located on, is a club that attracts a lot of crowd especially because of its prime location and its top-notch service. Baga beach, where the club is located, is a party hub so it is no wonder that loads of tourists find their way to Tito’s Street after sundown.  The club is known for its excellent services and this compensates amply for the slightly overpriced tags on drinks and food. The place is made up of two levels: the lower level is a dance floor with a separate dance space for couples; the upper level allows people to sit and watch the activity below while enjoying their food and drinks.

Pre-dating even the prestigious and much larger Fort Aguada, and situated at the narrowest point of the mouth of the Mandovi, it’s skilful construction and strategic placement made this fort nearly impregnable and it was an important asset to the Portuguese colonists.
